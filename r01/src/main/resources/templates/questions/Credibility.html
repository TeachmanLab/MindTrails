            <p th:text="#{credibility.text1}"> In our program, we are helping you change the way you think about common but potentially stressful
                situations in order to reduce your anxiety. During each session, you will be asked either to read
                information about anxiety problems and their treatment and then answer questions; or to read brief stories
                and then complete word fragments by filling in one or more missing letters in a word. These tasks are not
                meant to be tricky or too difficult.</p>

            <p><span th:text="#{credibility.text2}">The exercises are designed to help you change the way you make sense of events which may cause anxiety.
                The program can feel a little repetitive, but</span> <u th:text="#{credibility.text3}"> the repetition is important so you develop a more balanced thinking
                style.</u> <span th:text="#{credibility.text4}">Don’t worry if you don’t use smartphones or computers much — the tasks are not designed to be
                difficult, and you can always email questions to the team at </span> <a th:text="#{credibility.text5}">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a>.</p>

            <p th:text="#{credibility.text6}">This is an experimental program that is still in the testing phase, but prior research suggests this
                program may be able to reduce anxious thinking as effectively as therapy for some people. We want to determine
                if it can be helpful for you. If you would like to learn more about the science behind MindTrails,
                take a look at the "The Science of MindTrails" button at the top of the page.</p>
