                <p> In this study, we are going to focus on the way you think, and how that may affect your anxiety.
                    Specifically, we will focus on the way you interpret everyday events.</p>

                <p> It’s not always clear why anxiety persists over time, but one reason appears to be the way people
                    think about the things they are anxious about.</p>
                <b>For example:</b>
                <ul style="padding-right: 10px">
                    <li>People may think they are more likely to be negatively judged by others than they actually are.</li>
                    <li>People may think that they will not be able to cope with being in scary situations.</li></ul>
                <p>Past studies have shown that changing the way we think can affect our anxiety. In fact, studies have
                    shown that practice thinking about things in new ways may reduce anxiety symptoms.</p>

                <p>In our MindTrails program, you will complete an online training that will describe different
                    situations and encourage you to think about how those situations will turn out. This program is new
                    but is based on similar programs that have shown positive effects in changing anxious thinking.</p>

                <p>We have people trying different versions of the computer program for this study to see
                    which version works best – we think some of these computer programs will reduce anxiety by
                    changing the way people interpret situations.</p>
