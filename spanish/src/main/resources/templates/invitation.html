                <p>You reported experiencing some anxiety. As a result, you are eligible to participate in the
                    MindTrails study, a new Internet-based program designed to reduce anxious thinking.</p>

                <p>This is an experimental program, so it is still in the testing phase, but there are
                    many good reasons for you to participate. </p>

               <b>Reasons to participate:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prior research says it may reduce anxious thinking as effectively as therapy for some people.</li>
                    <li>It's FREE.</li>
                    <li>It will not require a lot of your time.</li>
                    <li>It can be completed anywhere — all you need is a computer, tablet, or smartphone with Internet access.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the study, we’ll give you feedback about how your anxiety symptoms have changed.</li>
                    <li>You can access a fun and interesting psychology demonstration after each session.</li>
                <!--    <li>You will receive up to 5 small payments for completing the assessments.</li> -->

                </ul>
