                <p><b><h3>What is the MindTrails Study?</h3></b></p>

                <p> The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, experimental anxiety reduction program called
                    MindTrails. The program consists of the following parts:</p>

                <ul style="padding-right: 10px">
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial assessment (15-20 min.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training Session 1 (15-20 min.) + assessment (2 min.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training Session 2 (15-20 min.) + assessment (2 min.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training Session 3 (15-20 min.) + assessment (15-20 min.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training Session 4 (15-20 min.) + assessment (2 min.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training Session 5 (15-20 min.) + assessment (15-20 min.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2-month follow-up assessment (15-20 min.)</li>
                </ul>

                <p> The program runs over the course of five weeks (one training session per week) with a two-month
                    follow-up assessment.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b><h3>What will I be asked to do?</h3></b></p>

                <p> The <b>assessments</b> consist of a number of questionnaires about your thoughts and mood, your
                    background, and personal mental health history.</p>

                <p> In the <b>training sessions</b>, you will be presented with one of a few different training programs
                    designed to shift how you think about situations. You will be asked to read brief stories and complete word fragments,
                    by filling in one or more missing letters in a word.</p>

                <p> At the end of the study, you will receive more details about the study's rationale and design. You
                    will also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b><h3>Are there any benefits or risks to participating?</h3></b></p>

                <p> The training program may help reduce symptoms of anxiety but there may be no direct benefits to you.</p>

                <p> There is no financial cost to you to take part in this study.</p>

                <p> For some participants, being asked to complete assessments about their thoughts and mood can be temporarily
                    distressing; however, most people experience minimal-to-no distress or do not feel distressed for extended
                    periods of time.</p>

                <p> Any time information is collected, there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality. While this is a
                    possible risk for this study, we will take careful, appropriate precautions to make sure that your information

                <p> While we hope that you will complete the entire study, remember that participation in this study is voluntary, and
                    you may end your individual session participation at any time by closing the study window. Further, your participation
                    in this study has no bearing on your standing with other ongoing therapy or employers. Contact the team
                    <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">here</a> if you have any questions about the study or to withdraw
                    completely from the study.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b><h3>Will my information and responses be kept confidential?</h3></b></p>

                <p> Your responses will be confidential. We ask you to provide your email address, phone number, name
                    and date of birth.</p>

                <p> Data collected through the MindTrails website are treated as confidential and are only accessible by
                    the research team. The only exceptions to this guideline are if we learn of possible child abuse or
                    neglect, or danger to self or others. In these instances, confidentiality would be limited given
                    mandated reporting requirements (e.g., to report the information to the police, or to child protective
                    services).</p>

                <p> Your identity will not be revealed in any publication or release of study results. However, your personal
                    information may be disclosed if required by law; e.g., to the following entities:</p>

                <p><b><h3>What is the MindTrails Privacy Policy?</h3></b></p>

                <p> MindTrails uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) that banks and other commercial
                    websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted format. This provides strong
                    security for data transfer to and from our website, though privacy is necessarily limited by the security
                    of the technology that is being used. To view the entire privacy policy in a separate page,
                    please <a th:href="@{/public/privacy}" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

                <p> Please note that completing the study in a public place where others might view your screen, and use
                    of open networks or free Wi-Fi can increase the chance for loss of privacy.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><u>Google Analytics</u></p>

                <p> MindTrails uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service by Google that tracks and reports website
                    traffic. MindTrails uses this service to track device usage, navigation patterns, and referrals.
                    While MindTrails can connect this data to other information you provide, we will not share any of
                    your personal information with Google. The information that Google collects is anonymous in nature,
                    and will not be personally identifiable. By participating in the MindTrails study, you consent to
                    this information being collected by Google Analytics.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><u>Data Sharing</u></p>

                <p> We wish to share de-identified data from this protocol online. Many funding agencies and journal outlets
                    encourage researchers to make data available to other researchers online. This is becoming a common practice
                    in research endeavors around the world and data sharing helps ensure that best practices in data analysis
                    are being upheld. The publication of data online involves preparing a data file for other researchers
                    that removes any personally identifying data from participants before making it available over the Internet.
                    Participants' names and other personally identifying information in this protocol will never be published
                    online. Importantly, open data sharing practices pose no threat to participants, as participants' names
                    and identifying information are never connected to the data they provide.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align:center"><b>Authorization to Use and Disclose <br></br>Protected Health Information</b></h2>
                <br></br>

                <p><b>Why is this authorization required?</b></p>

                <p> The Privacy Rule is a federal law designed to safeguard your Protected Health Information (PHI). Your
                    PHI is individually identifiable information about you, including your physical or mental health, the
                    receipt of health care, or payment for that care. The Privacy Rule requires that researchers obtain
                    your authorization to participate in this study.</p>

                <p> By providing your consent, you will permit Kaiser Permanente of Colorado (KPCO) and University of Virginia (UVA)
                    researchers to use and disclose your PHI for the purpose of this research study. Your PHI will only be used
                    and disclosed as described in this authorization, except as otherwise required by law.</p>

                <p> In order to participate in this research study, you must agree to the uses and disclosures of your PHI
                    as described in this authorization.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b>Who will use or disclose my PHI?</b></p>

                <p> KPCO researchers and the research team from the UVA will use your protected health information (PHI),
                    including survey responses, for the purposes of this study. No PHI will be disclosed to UVA without
                    the patient consent and HIPAA authorization you provide on this form.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b>What is the purpose of the use or disclosure of my PHI?</b></p>

                <p> KPCO and UVA researchers will use your PHI, including survey responses, to conduct the study, monitor
                    your level of anxiety, measure the effect of the MindTrails program and determine research results.</p>

                <p> Information from your research record used and disclosed for the study may include, for example, your
                    contact information (e.g. name, phone, email, address), scores on instruments that measure levels of
                    anxiety, your responses to questionnaires, and research observations relating to your participation
                    in the study. Researchers at KPCO and UVA will use extracts of electronic mental health records to
                    confirm your history of anxiety symptoms.</p>

                <p> This authorization to use and disclose your PHI will expire on August 30, 2027.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b>Can I withdraw this authorization?</b></p>

                <p> Yes, at any time during this study you may decide that you no longer want to have your PHI used or
                    disclosed as part of this study. If so, you must write a letter stating that you withdraw your
                    authorization and send it to:</p>

                    University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903</p>

                <p> If you withdraw your authorization, you will be required to end your participation in the study. KPCO
                    and UVA researchers and the study sponsor, National Institute of Health, may continue to use your PHI
                    that was obtained before you withdrew your authorization. KPCO and UVA researchers will not disclose
                    your PHI after they receive your written request except as required by law. For example, even if you
                    withdraw your authorization, KPCO and UVA researchers may be required by law to record and report
                    anything that relates to your safety or the safety of others.</p>
                <br></br>

                <p><b>What will happen to my PHI after it is disclosed?</b></p>

                <p> The KPCO and UVA research team will use and disclose your PHI only as described in this authorization.
                    However, if someone receives your PHI from KPCO or UVA and then discloses it again to someone else,
                    it may no longer be protected by the Privacy Rule.</p>
