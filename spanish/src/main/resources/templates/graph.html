                <p>You completed a questionnaire after each training session about how your anxiety had been since your
                    last session. This allowed us to track your progress over the course of the MindTrails
                    study.</p>
                <p>The graph below shows the changes in your score on the anxiety questionnaire, which is called the
                    <i>Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale</i> (Norman, Cissell, Means-Christensen, &amp;
                    Stein, 2006). On this scale, the higher the score, the
                    more difficulties with anxiety you reported at that point in time.</p>
                <p>The <b>orange line</b> shows your specific scores on each day. The <b>blue line</b> shows your
                    overall change pattern, taking into account the variation that occurred across sessions.</p>

                    you have made thus far, and we encourage you to keep working on managing your anxiety to
                    experience further improvement!

                    are many different treatment options that can be helpful, and we hope you will find a program
                    that is a good match for you.</p>
