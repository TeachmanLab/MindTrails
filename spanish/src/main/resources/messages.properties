# FAQ

faq.shortTitle=FAQ
faq.title=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.heading1=GENERAL QUESTIONS
faq.q1=1. I’ve completed some sessions and am still feeling anxious. Is the program not working for me?
faq.a1=Don’t give up! It can take time to learn how to use what you are learning in the sessions in your own life. It is important to keep completing the sessions and to honestly and accurately report your feelings throughout the program. You are helping us learn what works.
faq.q2=2. What if I miss a session? Can I do two the following week?
faq.a2=Try to complete one session each week. We will send you email reminders to help you remember when you should complete your next session. If you miss a session, complete it as soon as you have time (though we ask you to always leave at least one day between sessions).
faq.q3=3. Where and when can I do the sessions?
faq.a3=You can complete this program wherever and whenever you would like, as long as you have access to an Internet connection (through a smartphone, tablet, or computer). We strongly recommend that you complete the tasks when you are in a reasonably quiet place and able to pay full attention to them.
faq.q4=4. I have limited computer or smartphone skills. Can I still use this program?
faq.a4=Yes. Anyone with access to the Internet and an email address is welcome to use this site. If you can access your email and use an Internet browser, you have the skills needed to complete the study. No special skills are required. You will be asked to either click on your responses or type letters into boxes. Throughout the study, we will send you emails to update you on your progress and to remind you of upcoming tasks. You can also email us if you have any questions: studyteam@mindtrails.org.
faq.q5=5. Who created this program?
faq.a5=Researchers from the University of Virginia created these programs, but they were adapted from computer tasks that have usually been tested in research laboratories (see Hallion & Ruscio, 2011). As clinical scientists, we are interested in studying how well the programs work in the real world. In the long run, we want to create a cost-effective and accessible mental health treatment.
faq.q6=6. Is this really going to work for my anxiety?
faq.a6=This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research indicates it may be able to reduce feelings of anxiety. Even if you are not assigned to the training task condition, you will be given the opportunity to complete it.
faq.q7=7. I’m already receiving treatment for my anxiety (e.g., taking prescriptions or seeing a therapist). Can I still use this program?
faq.a7=Yes, anyone that qualifies from the questionnaire is welcome to use this program. Before you begin, you will be asked a series of questions about your mental health – please let us know if you are already receiving treatment.
faq.q8=8. What devices can I use to complete the program? Can I switch devices depending on where I am?
faq.a8=This study is available on computer, smartphone, and tablet. Currently supported Internet browsers are: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. You are welcome to switch between devices over the course of the study (for example, if you start the study on your computer but go on vacation during one of the study weeks, you can do the study from your smartphone). Just make sure to know your login information (including your password).
faq.heading2=SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROGRAM
faq.q9=1. When answering questions (following each of the brief stories), the program keeps telling me that my answer is incorrect.
faq.a9=Please answer the questions based on information given to you in the stories. Remember that it is essential that you fully involve yourself as if the events described are really happening to you, so your answers should reflect that.
faq.q10=2. When trying to complete word fragments at the end of the brief stories, the program keeps telling me my answer is incorrect.
faq.a10=Please complete the word fragments based only on information given to you in the brief stories.

# The Science of MindTrails

researchSupport.title=The Science of MindTrails
researchSupport.p1a=The program you’re completing is a type of intervention called
researchSupport.p1b=cognitive bias modification
researchSupport.p1c=(CBM), and it is designed to help you change how you think in response to situations that make you feel anxious or upset.
researchSupport.heading1=What Are Cognitive Biases?
researchSupport.p2=Cognitive biases are tendencies to pay attention to, remember, and interpret things differently when processing information tied to your emotional responses. For example, sometimes it can be difficult to tell whether something that happens is good or bad. Our tendency to interpret these ambiguous events as positive or negative can happen very rapidly and even without our being aware of our interpretation, so it can be difficult to catch these thinking habits — even though a tendency to routinely interpret things in negative ways can make us feel more anxious or sad. That’s where CBM might help.
researchSupport.heading2=Changing Cognitive Biases
researchSupport.p3=CBM works by giving people lots of practice processing information in new ways to help develop healthier thinking habits. These tasks may seem repetitive, and it is not always obvious what the program is doing. However, there is growing evidence that CBM can be an effective method for reducing negative feelings, like anxiety and sadness.
researchSupport.p4=Several research studies have shown that CBM is effective at changing interpretations in people with clinical levels of anxiety. Further, many studies have found that CBM leads to decreases in anxiety symptoms and/or anxious reactions to potentially stressful situations, compared to control conditions (a condition that may look like the active training but is not expected to work as well).
researchSupport.p5=Participants are randomly assigned to either the active training or control conditions. At the end of the study, we can test whether the active training condition was more effective in promoting healthier thinking and emotional responses. It is normal to have some concerns about being placed in a control condition. In our study, every participant will have a chance to experience the condition that we expect to be most effective.
researchSupport.heading3=Treatment Components
researchSupport.p6=Studies have shown that repeated training of CBM can be especially beneficial, because it provides more opportunities to practice healthier ways of thinking than a single training session. This is why we set up multiple brief sessions of training. Similarly, studies have found that biases in how you picture things in your mind are closely connected to difficulties with anxiety, which is why the program includes exercises where participants imagine certain scenarios.
researchSupport.heading4=The Need for Research
researchSupport.p7=Although there are many examples of CBM programs helping to reduce anxiety, and even helping other problem areas like depression, substance use (e.g., alcohol abuse), eating disorders, and anger problems (among others), there are also some mixed findings. Not all studies using these approaches get the same results, and some studies find decreases in one anxiety measure but not another. Also, more research needs to be done to find the optimal number of training sessions, and to figure out how to make CBM as effective if completed online as in the clinic or lab. Though there are still open questions, one goal of this site is to work on answering these questions in order to refine and improve this promising treatment method.
researchSupport.heading5=Research Papers on CBM by the MindTrails Team
researchSupport.p8=Here are some of the main research papers examining CBM by our team (papers marked with ★ use MindTrails data):

resources.p1d=Remember that everyone struggles with feelings of sadness or worry or not liking how they look, etc. It is normal to experience these feelings at times, and having a few symptoms does not mean that you meet criteria for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. However, we recommend that you consider seeking a professional evaluation if you are experiencing these symptoms more strongly than is typical for you (or for most other people you know), for an extended period of time (e.g., extremely sad mood for more than a couple weeks), or if the symptoms start to interfere with your ability to live your life in the way you want.

# ACCOUNT PAGES

# Debriefing

debriefing.p1=We are currently investigating experimental approaches to reduce anxiety. The experimental approaches used in the study are based on models of anxiety, which have shown that anxious people tend to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening. It has been proposed that the tendency to interpret things in a threatening way plays a role in the onset of, and recovery from, anxiety problems.
debriefing.p2=In the current study, we are evaluating if it is possible to change interpretation patterns over the Internet, and whether changing these interpretation patterns will reduce anxiety symptoms.
debriefing.p3=If you are interested in learning more about modifying thinking patterns, see the following websites:
